## 📖 Development Experience & Realized Projects

People often ask me about the projects I’ve had the opportunity to work on - both commercial and personal - the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

Below is a list of successfully completed projects that showcase my experience across different areas of software development.

### 💻 Frontend

1. **[New Frontend Project]** I built the entire frontend project from scratch. Approximately 50 components in **React.js** and **Vue.js**. Based on an old legacy project with at least 5-year-old packages, I rewrote the whole thing as a new project alongside it - refactoring wasn't entirely cost-effective.

2. **[Accessability - WCAG]**  I worked on improving accessibility for the entire application. The whole thing was based on WCAG documentation. The changes included **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)** components. The effects were measured using the “**WAVE**” browser plugin.

3. **[Headless CMS Components]** I created components for Headless CMS in **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)**. Components configurable and editable in Experience & Content Editor. Data was delivered to the component using **REST API**.

4. **[Frontend & Website Performance]** I worked on improving the performance of the application/website. I improved Google ratings in **Lighthouse** and reduced page and component loading times. I optimized the frontend using **Webpack** (minification, .gzip packaging, memoization, scss refactor).
