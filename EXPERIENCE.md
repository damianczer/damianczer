## 📖 Development Experience & Realized Projects

People often ask me about the projects I’ve had the opportunity to work on - both commercial and personal - the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

Below is a list of successfully completed projects that showcase my experience across different areas of software development.

---

### 💻 Frontend

1. **[New Frontend Project]** - I built the entire frontend project from scratch. Approximately 50 components in **React.js** and **Vue.js**. Based on an old legacy project with at least 5-year-old packages, I rewrote the whole thing as a new project alongside it - refactoring wasn't entirely cost-effective.

2. **[Accessability - WCAG]** - I worked on improving accessibility for the entire application. The whole thing was based on WCAG documentation. The changes included **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)** components. The effects were measured using the “**WAVE**” browser plugin.

3. **[Headless CMS Components]** - I created components for Headless CMS in **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)**. Components configurable and editable in Experience & Content Editor. Data was delivered to the component using **REST API**.

4. **[Frontend & Website Performance]** - I worked on improving the performance of the application/website. I improved **Google** ratings in **Lighthouse** and reduced page and component loading times. I optimized the frontend using **Webpack** (minification, .gzip packaging, memoization, scss refactor).

5. **[Redux Components]** - I created and refactored components with global **Redux** state. I converted components from **SPA** to **Web Components**.

6. **[Pure JavaScript Components]** - I built components based on pure **JavaScript**, including controls such as checkboxes, textboxes, etc. The goal was to get rid of **end-of-life** frontend packages.

7. **[jQuery Components]** - I worked with the **jQuery** library and created components based on it. Currently, **jQuery** is no longer widely used.

8. **[CSS Libraries]** - I worked with CSS libraries such as **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind**. I styled components based on them.

9. **[AJAX]** - I built components with **CRUD** data operation logic using **AJAX**. I created **synchronous** and **asynchronous** functions to manipulate the application correctly.

10. **[TypeScript]** - I created components and libraries using **TypeScript**. It is my favorite language, which should completely replace **JavaScript**.

11. **[Material-UI]** - I created components, entire forms, and pages using **Material-UI** from **Google**. It's a very cool library of ready-made components, but it has its drawbacks and depends on maintaining the validity of external packages.

12. **[Vuetify]** - I built the company intranet using **Vue 3** and **vuetify** to speed up work on the site - I'm not a fan of ready-made solutions.

13. **[styled-components]** - I worked daily with **React.js** components styled using **styled-components**. This solution has its pros and cons.

14. **[Webpack]** - I created a project from scratch based on **Webpack**. I worked with various Webpack modules and optimized the project using its capabilities.

15. **[Yarn]** - I have worked with the **Yarn** package manager, which allows for significant optimization and improvement of developers' work. I am familiar with its capabilities and know how to configure it.

16. **[Figma & Adobe Xd]** - I worked with a designer who provided me with designs for forms and components in **Figma** and **Adobe Xd**. I am familiar with both software programs and can use them fluently.

17. **[React.js]** - I have built entire applications and various components in multiple versions of **React.js**. I am familiar with both **class-based** and **functional** component approaches. I know most of the most popular **Hooks** and work very fluently with **JSX**.

18. **[Vue.js]** - I have used the **Vue.js** framework many times. I created components from scratch and developed existing ones. I used templates and combined **Vue.js** with **Razor Views (.cshtml)**.

19. **[Saas]** - On a daily basis, I tend to use **Saas** classic **CSS** is not very optimal. I build **style function**s and shared blocks. I create **global variables** so that you can easily manipulate, for example, application colors or leading styles.

20. **[Frontend Packages (NPM)]** - I upgraded frontend packages to the latest version. Often, the jump was significant and there were **breaking changes**, which led to code refactoring. The biggest challenge is **compatibility**, because many packages are dependent on each other. That's why sometimes upgrading one package requires upgrading another, or sometimes it's not even possible to use the latest version.

### 🛠️ DevOps & CMS & Other

1. **[Git]** - I have extensive experience with **Git**. I like the GUI version - **Git Extensions**. I have created **branches**, **pull requests**, **resolved conflicts**, and done **cherry picks**.
   
2. **[PowerShell]** - I am very familiar with **PowerShell** and use it commercially at least several times a month. I create advanced scripts as well as quick and simple ones. This language is very versatile and its applications are countless.

3. **[Azure DevOps]** - I know a few things about **Azure DevOps**. I had the opportunity to automate some tasks, build **pipelines**, and configure **KANBAN** boards.

4. **[CI/CD]** - I created a proprietary **CI/CD pipeline** that built the entire solution using **MSBuild**, created a **NuGet** package from it, and then deployed it to the client server. An additional feature was a solution that detected changes – instead of building from the **.sln** file, a **git compare** was performed, and **MSBuild** received information about which of the nearly 200 projects to build. This was a very big improvement.

5. **[Sitecore 8.2 > 10.2]** - I worked on migrating **Sitecore** **8.2** to version **10.2**. It was a very large project that took the development team over a year to complete. The changes were so extensive that large amounts of code had to be rewritten in **.NET**.

6. **[IIS Rewrite Rules]** - I worked on the **IIS server** module responsible for page redirections. IIS itself has this feature, but my solution was designed for **CMS**. The Content Editor could configure redirects using **.csv** files. (e.g., we disable the old subpage, but users may then receive a **404** error - we redirect from the old page to the new URL. The customer will not receive an error and will see the appropriate content).

7. **[Octopus Deplyment Process]** - I built a proprietary software deployment process in **Octopus Deployment (CD)**. The whole thing was based on **PowerShell** scripts. The process used a **NuGet** package to install the application on the client server. It included an option for a full reinstallation of **CMS**, **Identity Server**, and **prerequisites**.

8. **[IIS Verbs & Proxy]** - I remotely configured and implemented additional features necessary for the application to function using **PowerShell**. The script enabled secure **verbs** such as **DELETE**, set up a **proxy** so that the site could be used externally, and much more.

9. **[CMS Expansion]** - I added **custom features** to the **CMS** platform by modifying the **GUI** and interfering with the **CORE database**. The **CMS** gained new content management capabilities, e.g., a button in the navigation bar with an additional option and mechanism.

10. **[IT Administrator]** - I often helped as an **administrator** with various issues related to the application. From server configuration to implementation and modification of additional software.

11. **[Security Raport]** - I analyzed security reports, e.g., **Qualys**, and implemented solutions to eliminate threats in the application.

12. **[.dll Decompilation & Debuging]** - When the problem was more complicated, I **decompiled libraries** to understand what happened in the **error call stack**, sometimes connecting a **debugger** to view the data. **Dotpeek** often helped me.

13. **[Custom .aspx Implementation]** - I have written mini **.aspx** programs to handle things in connection with **CMS** from the code or script level. Among other things, I wrote a program that publishes content using the **smart** method with the **Sitecore** library.

14. **[Sitecore.CLI & Serizalization]** - I used the **console version** of the software to maintain **CMS items** in the solution. I also created my own **serialization process** in **Azure DevOps** and **Octopus Deployment (PowerShell)**.

15. **[TDS]** - I created projects using **Team Development for Sitecore**. I also managed items using a **GUI** plugin for **Visual Studio**.

### 📢 Project Management

1. **[Release Maintener]** - I was responsible for application **releases**. I fixed **bugs** as they arose. I led technical meetings and planned deployments. I performed manual **deployments** with testing - both **test** and **production**. I handled urgent requests from clients.

2. **[Technical & Business Analysis]** - I held discussions with the client to determine their **requirements**. I conducted **technical analyses** to adapt and propose the final solution. I also estimated the work in **Story Points** or **Mendays**.

3. **[Temporary Project Manager]** - I led internal and external meetings when the team project manager was unavailable. I also gave presentations on features to clients.

4. **[KANBAN Support]** - I took care of the **KANBAN board** — I set **deployment statuses**. I asked less important questions to the client in the comments section. I monitored the progress of tasks in the sprint. I created **Release Notes**.

5. **[Documentation (Technical, Business Logic, User Guides)]** - I created **technical documentation** for features and wrote **business logic**, including **UML diagrams**. I built **User Guides** - instructions for customers on how to use/configure features.

6. **[End-To-End]** - I often worked as a **Web Developer**. This meant that I took care of a given task **from start to finish**. From **gathering requirements** to **implementation** and **deployment** into **production**. Often, the actual work on the code was only **30%** of the job—the rest was the entire process of developing and delivering software on time and with the right quality.

7. **[Junior-Support]** - I trained less experienced programmers and took them under my wing. They performed tasks under my supervision and had their **code reviewed**.

8. **[Agile]** - I have worked extensively with the **Agile** methodology, which I find excellent. I have participated in meetings such as: **Retrospective**, **Brainstorming and Estimation**, **Backlog Refinement**, **Daily**, Statuses****, **AMS**, Coffee Talks, and others. I have delivered software iteratively in the form of sprints.
