## 📖 Development Experience & Realized Projects

People often ask me about the projects I’ve had the opportunity to work on - both commercial and personal - the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

Below is a list of successfully completed projects that showcase my experience across different areas of software development.

### 💻 Frontend

1. **[New Frontend Project]** - I built the entire frontend project from scratch. Approximately 50 components in **React.js** and **Vue.js**. Based on an old legacy project with at least 5-year-old packages, I rewrote the whole thing as a new project alongside it - refactoring wasn't entirely cost-effective.

2. **[Accessability - WCAG]** - I worked on improving accessibility for the entire application. The whole thing was based on WCAG documentation. The changes included **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)** components. The effects were measured using the “**WAVE**” browser plugin.

3. **[Headless CMS Components]** - I created components for Headless CMS in **React.js**, **Vue.js**, and **Razor (.cshtml)**. Components configurable and editable in Experience & Content Editor. Data was delivered to the component using **REST API**.

4. **[Frontend & Website Performance]** - I worked on improving the performance of the application/website. I improved **Google** ratings in **Lighthouse** and reduced page and component loading times. I optimized the frontend using **Webpack** (minification, .gzip packaging, memoization, scss refactor).

5. **[Redux Components]** - I created and refactored components with global **Redux** state. I converted components from **SPA** to **Web Components**.

6. **[Pure JavaScript Components]** - I built components based on pure **JavaScript**, including controls such as checkboxes, textboxes, etc. The goal was to get rid of **end-of-life** frontend packages.

7. **[jQuery Components]** - I worked with the **jQuery** library and created components based on it. Currently, **jQuery** is no longer widely used.

8. **[CSS Libraries]** - I worked with CSS libraries such as **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind**. I styled components based on them.

9. **[AJAX]** - I built components with **CRUD** data operation logic using **AJAX**. I created **synchronous** and **asynchronous** functions to manipulate the application correctly.

10. **[TypeScript]** - I created components and libraries using **TypeScript**. It is my favorite language, which should completely replace **JavaScript**.

11. **[Material-UI]** - I created components, entire forms, and pages using **Material-UI** from **Google**. It's a very cool library of ready-made components, but it has its drawbacks and depends on maintaining the validity of external packages.

12. **[Vuetify]** - I built the company intranet using **Vue 3** and **vuetify** to speed up work on the site - I'm not a fan of ready-made solutions.

13. **[styled-components]** - I worked daily with **React.js** components styled using **styled-components**. This solution has its pros and cons.
